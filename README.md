## What is UML?

UML, or Unified Modeling Language, is a standard modeling language primarily used in software engineering to visualize the structure and behavior of software systems. It employs a variety of diagrams, such as class, sequence, and use case diagrams, to visually represent different aspects of a system.



## UML Diagrams

In the context of UML, static and dynamic representation refer to different aspects of depicting a system.

### Static Representation or Structure Diagrams:

Static representation focuses on the structure of the system. It illustrates the different elements of the system and how they relate to each other. The main UML diagrams used for static representation include:

1. **Class Diagram:** Represents the classes and the relationships among them. [See more](class-diagrams.md)
2. **Object Diagram:** Illustrates instances of classes and the relationships between those instances.
3. **Component Diagram:** Shows the software components and their dependencies.
4. **Package Diagram:** Represents the organization of modeling elements into packages and the dependencies between packages.
5. **Composite Structure Diagram:** Illustrates the internal structure of a class and the collaborations that this structure makes possible.
6. **Deployment Diagram:** Represents the hardware used in system implementations and the software components, processes, and objects deployed on the hardware.


### Dynamic Representation or Behavior Diagrams:

Dynamic representation, on the other hand, focuses on the behavior and interaction of the system elements over time. The UML diagrams associated with dynamic representation include:

1. **Sequence Diagram:** Represents the sequence of messages exchanged between objects in a given scenario.
2. **State Machine Diagram:** Shows the lifecycle of an object, illustrating its possible states and the transitions between them.
3. **Activity Diagram:** Illustrates the flow of control among activities and actions in the system.
4. **Use Case Diagram:** Represents the interactions between the system and its users (actors) through different use cases.
5. **Interaction Overview Diagram:** Provides an overview of the flow of control where nodes are interactions or interaction uses.
6. **Timing Diagram:** Represents the behavior of objects in a given time frame, focusing especially on the timing of events.
7. **Communication Diagram:** Shows the interactions between objects or parts in terms of sequenced messages.
